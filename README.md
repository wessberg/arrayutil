# ArrayUtil

## Description

I needed a simple collection of helpers for working with arrays which works within dependency injection setups.
This library has a few of such methods.

Specifically, I needed a well-typed version of the proposed `Array.prototype.flatten` (or whatever it is gonna end up being called thanks to MooTools).

## Installation

`npm install @wessberg/arrayutil`
